This code transforms a Raspberry Pi and an MPU6050 (the little accel/gyro board typically labeled GY-521) into a simple, menu-driven gait tracker. With the sensor connected up across I²C (VCC→3.3V, GND→GND, SDA→GPIO2, SCL→GPIO3, AD0→GND for address 0x68) and I²C activated on the Pi, the software wakes the sensor up, reads acceleration and gyroscope data every time, and does a simple high-pass filter to eliminate gravity and leave motion. It watches for filtered Y-axis acceleration for steps with a user-defined threshold and short cooldown to prevent double-counting.

You start out by collecting a short baseline: choose a threshold (0.4 g is a good default) and the number of steps. While moving, the script collects linear acceleration and angular velocity samples to gait_data.csv once a first step is detected. Subsequently, choose "Compare," use the same number of steps, and the script computes the mean six-value feature vector (ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz) from the live and record sessions. It returns the Euclidean distance between them—low means your gait isn't particularly different from baseline ("NORMAL"); high means a striking difference ("ABNORMAL"). A minimal matplotlib plot shows both mean vectors side-by-side for a visual inspection.

The approach is minimalist by design: no training, no calibration, no heavy signal processing—just filtering, thresholding, elementary stats, and a CSV that you can inspect or reuse. That simplifies tuning too. If steps are not detected reliably, twiddle the threshold up or down. If you require more resolution, increase the sampling rate by reducing the sleep interval. For accurate results, secure the sensor tightly (shoe tongue or ankle strap) and keep orientation the same from session to session. It's not a medical device, but a convenient way to note important changes in gait, track recovery, or experiment with wearable motion sensing with cheap hardware.
